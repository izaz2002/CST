# Proposal

## What will (likely) be the title of your project?

My project title will be tetris puzzle.

## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "A website that lets you buy and sell stocks.")

My project will be a game that user can play and spend some free times.

## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?

In this game user have complete lines with different blocks. This blocks will fall from the center of the display and blocks will be different shapes and colors. In this game user have to complete rows. When user will complete the rows the rows will disappear and user will get points. If user fail to complete raws the the blocks column will get bigger and when column blocks hit the top of display game will over. The game will also have infinite level. User can pause the game if they need to.
